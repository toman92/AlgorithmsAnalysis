# AlgorithmsAnalysis
Algorithms and Data Structures assignment.
Java GUI program to carry out Emperical Analysis of four inefficient sorting algorithms. 
Standard bubble sort, enhanced bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort lgorithms are analised.
The algorithms are tested against sorted, unsorted and inversely sorted data and are also testing against 
data sets of 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000 elements.
The algorithms are timed in nanoseconds and also how many checks (reads) and swaps (writes) occurred are recorder.
